        <description>
            <p>On many worlds, the moon is a revered celestial body with magical properties. On Krynn, the gods of magic are associated with the world's three moons. On the world of Toril, the god Selûne uses the light of the moon to battle darkness. On Eberron, scholars of the Draconic Prophecy decipher ancient secrets from the waxing and waning of that world's twelve moons.</p>
            <p class="indent">You or someone from your lineage has been exposed to the concentrated magic of the moon (or moons) of your world, imbuing you with lunar magic. Perhaps your ancestor was involved in a druidic ritual involving an eclipse, or maybe a mystical fragment of a moon crashed near you. However you came to have your magic, your connection to the moon is obvious when you cast sorcerer spells-perhaps making your pupils glow with the color of a moon from your world, causing spectral manifestations of lunar phases to orbit you, or some other effect.</p>

You learn the Sacred Flame spell, which doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer cantrips you know.

                Starting at 6th level, the current phase of your Lunar Embodiment can affect your Metamagic feature. Each Lunar Embodiment phase is associated with certain schools of magic, as shown here:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full Moon</strong><p>Abjuration and Divination spells</p></li>
                <li><strong>New Moon</strong><p>Evocation and Necromancy spells</p></li>
                <li><strong>Crescent Moon</strong><p>Divination and Transmutation</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Whenever you use Metamagic on a spell of a school of magic associated with your current Lunar Embodiment phase, you can reduce the sorcery points spent by 1 (minimum 0). You can reduce the sorcery points spent for your Metamagic a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest
